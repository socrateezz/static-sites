Each there in payment of their family's debt, but without an understanding of the price they'd pay in support of the Alderman's scheme. Surl Niop hoped to outwit them all. Instead of serving the Alderman he had an imposter take his place.\n\nTo consolidate his grip on his city of Cantoc, the Alderman hoped to join the ranks of an influential religious order and schemed to have others pay the price for his entry.\n\nOthers are caught in the path of his ambitions, and the Alderman greeted each with the same opportunistic and calculating responses.\n\nThe Alderman is a frank exposition of human weakness and a stark look at the avarice of man.",
